# ML_bootcamp
## Description:- 
This project contains different machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression and KNN.
These models predict a value based on the various input values. For example: predicting the price of a house based on its area, number of rooms etc., predicting whether it is going to rain or not based on parameters like humidity, speed of wind etc.
All the different algorithms were written in python on Google Colab from scratch using only the basic libraries of Numpy, Matplotlib and pandas.
## Getting started:-
To access the program code, click on the link that is attached with the .ipynb files. Clicking on this link would redirect you to Google colab where the code for the particular algorithm is written.

I learned a lot of stuff during this journey of Winter of Code 5.0 from learning basic python to building various machine libraries. It has been fun studying and writing about how different algorithms work and I hope I get to experience all of this again.
